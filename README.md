1. Copy all the contents from this repository.
2. Copy all files and directories to the htdocs directory inside xampp (for example: C:\xampp\htdocs\CMSC127-MP1-Yao_SJ), where "CMSC127-MP1-Yao_SJ" will contain all of the files.
3. Import the database [thirdyear_courses.sql] in phpmyadmin or directly embed it into your MySQL database through the command prompt (refer to this link on how - https://www.warp.dev/terminus/mysql-import-sql-file).
